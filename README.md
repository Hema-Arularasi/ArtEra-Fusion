# ArtEra-Fusion
This repository contains Python scripts for performing artistic style transfer using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. The scripts allow users to transfer the style of famous artworks onto their own images, creating visually stunning results.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- OpenCV
- NumPy
You can install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Alternate 
Download the ipynb file given and open it in jupyter(anaconda 3)
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/Hema-Arularasi/ArtEra-Fusion
2.  Navigate to the project directory:cd artistic-style-transfer
3.  Run the main script
4.   Follow the on-screen instructions to input the paths of the content and style images.
5. View the stylized image generated by the script.
